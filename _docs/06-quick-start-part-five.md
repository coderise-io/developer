### Continuous Deployment

1. While creating a new service, users can provide deployment commands as part of onboarding workflow.
2. In the 'Stack' section, select Technology e.g. LAMP, AWS or Azure and then click the script section to edit commands.
3. Save your changes and proceed to next step.
4. The commands are saved in a script which automatically gets committed to the repository.
5. The script gets executed as part of build step in the pipeline.
